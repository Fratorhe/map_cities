title: "City Explorer: Discover the Best Local Spots"

intro: "Whenever I travel to a new city, I always try to experience it like a local. 
I often turn to my friends who live or have lived there for recommendations, but it can be tough to keep track of all the messages and share them with others.  
That's why I created this website - a one-stop-shop for all the best local spots, curated by people who know the city inside and out. 
I hope you find it useful!"
